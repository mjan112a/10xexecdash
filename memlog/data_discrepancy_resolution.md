# Data Discrepancy Resolution Report
**Date**: June 9, 2025  
**Issue**: Discrepancies between CSV file data and metrics tab display  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

## Problem Summary
The user reported discrepancies between the raw CSV data and what was displayed in the metrics tab. Investigation revealed that different APIs were using different CSV files, causing revenue values to not match between the main metrics display and monthly report generation.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Original Issue**: Currency values in CSV had inconsistent formatting (resolved previously)
2. **NEW ISSUE**: Different CSV files being used by different APIs:
   - **Main Metrics API** (`/api/metrics/route.ts`): Used automatic file detection (latest file)
   - **Monthly Report Direct API** (`/api/monthly-report-direct/route.ts`): Used hardcoded old file (`10X Business Metrics - 03-06-2025e.csv`)

## Solution Implemented
1. **Centralized CSV Configuration**: Created `lib/csv-config.ts` for single-point CSV file management
2. **Updated Both APIs**: Modified both APIs to use the centralized configuration
3. **Easy Maintenance**: Now only need to update one file when new data arrives

## Files Modified
- `lib/csv-config.ts` - **NEW**: Centralized CSV file configuration
- `app/api/metrics/route.ts` - Updated to use centralized config
- `app/api/monthly-report-direct/route.ts` - Updated to use centralized config

## Current Configuration
- **Latest CSV File**: `10X Business Metrics Through Apr 2025 - 06-04-2025candp1.csv`
- **Version**: April 2025 - Clean Data
- **Last Updated**: 2025-06-09

## How to Update for New Data
When new CSV data arrives:
1. Place the new CSV file in the project root directory
2. Update **only** the `LATEST_CSV_FILENAME` in `lib/csv-config.ts`
3. Update the `LAST_UPDATED` and `VERSION` fields for documentation
4. Both APIs will automatically use the new file

## Test Results
### Before Fix:
- ❌ Different CSV files used by different APIs
- ❌ Revenue discrepancies between metrics display and monthly reports
- ❌ Manual updates required in multiple locations

### After Fix:
- ✅ Single CSV file used by all APIs
- ✅ Consistent data across all features
- ✅ Single-point maintenance for CSV updates

## Prevention Measures
1. **Centralized Configuration**: All CSV references go through `lib/csv-config.ts`
2. **Documentation**: Clear instructions for updating CSV files
3. **Consistency**: Both APIs use identical data source

## Key Learnings
- Centralized configuration prevents data source mismatches
- Single-point updates reduce maintenance overhead
- Clear documentation helps with future data updates
- Consistent data sources are crucial for accurate reporting

## Recommendations for Future
1. Always use the centralized CSV configuration
2. Test both metrics display and monthly reports when updating data
3. Consider adding validation to ensure CSV file exists before using it
4. Document any new APIs that need CSV data to use the centralized config
