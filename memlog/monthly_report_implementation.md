# Monthly Report System Implementation

## Date
March 15, 2025

## Overview

   - Defined TypeScript types for type safety

2. **Report Context Provider**
   - Implemented state management for reports
   - Created functions for CRUD operations on reports, highlights, and graphs

3. **UI Components**
   - ReportManager: For creating and selecting reports
   - ReportSection: Collapsible sections for each part of the report
   - HighlightEntryForm: Form for entering highlights
   - GraphManager: For managing graphs in each section
   - ReportGenerator: For generating and previewing reports

4. **Metrics Integration**
   - Added SaveToReport component to the metrics page
   - Implemented functionality to save graphs to reports

5. **PDF Generation**
   - Enhanced PDF template with 10X logo
   - Improved layout and formatting
   - Added footer with confidentiality notice

6. **LLM Integration**
   - Updated system prompt for the new template structure

### Report Template Enhancements
- Updated the system prompt (`monthlyrptsysprompt.txt`) with detailed requirements for each section
- Added specific graphs and tables that should be included in each section
- Enhanced the highlight entry form with suggestions for required visualizations
- Improved the financial statements section with clearer requirements for tables

### WYSIWYG Report Preview
- Created a new `PDFPreview` component that exactly mimics the PDF output
- Added a "WYSIWYG" tab to the Report Generator that shows the report as it will appear in PDF
- Implemented enhanced table rendering with:
  - Proper headers with background colors
  - Borders and alternating row colors
  - Automatic detection and alignment of numeric values
  - Table numbering and captions
- Enhanced graph display with:
  - Figure numbers and captions
  - Proper sizing and borders
  - Consistent styling
- Added print functionality:
  - Direct printing from the browser
  - Print-specific CSS in globals.css
  - Page break controls to prevent tables and figures from breaking across pages
- Made the WYSIWYG tab the default after generating a report

### Testing Enhancements
- Added checkboxes for using generic content in each input field:
  - Created generic content templates for each section
  - Implemented checkbox UI in the HighlightEntryForm component
  - Added state tracking for generic content usage
- Implemented sequential field generation:
  - Modified ReportGenerator to process one field at a time
  - Added progress tracking with a progress bar
  - Created field-specific prompts for more focused content
  - Added support for skipping fields that use generic content
- Updated API route to handle individual field submissions
- Added Progress component for visual feedback during generation

### Data-Driven Report Improvements
- Integrated metrics data into monthly report generation:
  - Modified API route to fetch data from the metrics API
  - Created functions to format metrics data for the LLM
  - Enhanced the message sent to the LLM with structured metrics data
- Updated system prompt to emphasize data accuracy:
  - Added explicit instructions to use only provided metrics
  - Included examples of proper data referencing
  - Added requirements for specific comparisons to previous periods
- Improved report quality by ensuring:
  - All metrics mentioned are based on actual data
  - Trend analysis includes specific percentage changes
  - Comparisons reference exact figures from previous months
  - No hallucinated or made-up metrics are included

### Complete Metrics Data Integration
- Enhanced metrics data formatting to include ALL historical data:
  - Modified the `formatMetricsForLLM` function to include all months
  - Added date reference section to help the LLM understand the time periods
  - Improved data presentation format for better LLM comprehension
- Organized metrics by report section:
  - Grouped metrics according to their relevant report sections
  - Created dedicated sections for Business Performance, Sales, Marketing, etc.
  - Made it easier for the LLM to find the right metrics for each section
- Improved system prompt with detailed instructions:
  - Added specific guidance on trend analysis and data usage
  - Included instructions for calculating percentage changes
  - Emphasized the importance of year-over-year comparisons
- Added comprehensive logging:
  - Tracked metrics data processing with detailed logs
  - Added character count logging for formatted metrics data
  - Improved error handling for metrics data fetching

### Dynamic Report Month Analysis
- Implemented report month detection and targeted analysis:
  - Added function to extract month and year from report title
  - Modified metrics formatting to focus on the specific report month
  - Highlighted the report month, previous month, and same month last year in the data
- Enhanced analysis instructions for the LLM:
  - Added section-specific analysis instructions for each part of the report
  - Provided clear guidance on calculating month-over-month and year-over-year changes
  - Included specific metrics to focus on for each section
- Added field-specific instructions for targeted content generation:
  - Created specialized prompts for each report section (Business Performance, Sales, etc.)
  - Tailored instructions based on the specific metrics relevant to each section
  - Ensured consistent analysis approach across all report sections
- Improved data presentation for LLM analysis:
  - Clearly marked the report month, previous month, and year-over-year comparison month
  - Organized metrics data to facilitate easy comparison and trend identification
  - Structured the data to encourage the LLM to perform calculations within its context window

## Next Steps

1. **Testing and Refinement**
   - Test the full workflow with browser storage
   - Verify that all features work without database access
   - Refine the UX based on testing results
   
2. **Future Database Integration**
   - Keep the SQL schema for future Supabase implementation
   - Plan for data migration from localStorage to Supabase
   - Design authentication flow for when database is implemented

2. **User Testing**
   - Test the full workflow from creating a report to generating the PDF
   - Gather feedback on usability

3. **Enhancements**
   - Implement graph embedding in PDFs
   - Add collaborative editing features
   - Create version history tracking

## Notes

- The current implementation uses localStorage for saving graphs as a temporary solution
- In a production environment, this would be replaced with proper API calls to the database
- The PDF generation could be further enhanced to include actual graph images rather than references
