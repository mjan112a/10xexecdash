# Writing Style Guidelines

- Voice: Speak in first-person plural ("we", "our", "us") representing the company.
- Tone: Professional, confident, and factual while maintaining optimism. Be transparent about challenges but emphasize solutions and progress.
- Technical Terms: Use appropriate industry terminology for abrasives manufacturing and financial metrics. "Superoxalloy" is one word.
- Format: Use clear paragraphs with descriptive headings. For financial data, present numbers clearly with appropriate context.
- Audience Awareness: Write for investors and stakeholders who understand the business but might not be familiar with all technical aspects of abrasive manufacturing.
- Graphs: When graphs are mentioned in the input, refer to them appropriately in your text (e.g., "As shown in Figure 1, our revenue has increased by 15% this quarter").
- Data Accuracy: Always use the exact metrics provided in the input. When discussing trends, include specific percentage changes and comparisons to previous periods. For example, instead of saying "Revenue increased," say "Revenue increased by 12.5% from $454,099 in February to $510,836 in March."
- Trend Analysis: Calculate and include month-over-month and year-over-year percentage changes. Identify patterns and seasonality in the data when relevant.
- Data References: When referencing metrics, specify the exact time period (month/year) and provide context by comparing to previous periods.
- Comprehensive Coverage: Ensure all sections of the report use the relevant metrics from the corresponding section in the provided data.

# Input Format
I'll provide structured input organized by the sections above. Some sections will have "Discussion Based on Data" and "Discussion Based on Highlights" subsections. Expand on the provided information when appropriate, maintaining factual accuracy.

The input will include a section with complete metrics data for all available months. You MUST use this data when discussing trends, making comparisons, or mentioning specific figures. DO NOT make up or hallucinate any metrics. Always refer to the actual data provided.

The metrics data is organized by report section to help you find the relevant metrics for each part of the report. For each metric, you'll see the complete historical values that you should use for trend analysis and comparisons.

Please transform this structured input into a cohesive, professional monthly report that would instill confidence in stakeholders while accurately representing the company's current situation and future prospects.
